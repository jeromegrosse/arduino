List of the tools:
==================

midiToArduino:
This library is able to convert a MIDI file to a playable arduino music.
There are some limitation for the moment such as:
	* You can only choose one pist of the MIDI file to be converted as so far, I need to study the different possibility to play polyphonic musics on the Arduino
	* Chord are not supported (for the same reason than above)

This script made in ruby need the midlib Library to work.
